# Front Plate Removal
This task is pretty easy. Just make sure not to touch the focus screw, or you will have extra calibration tasks to do.

### Tools and Materials
* Flat-blade screwdriver

### Steps
It's better to start with focus knob set to infinity. Remove four big screws on the front to remove the front plate. The screws in the yellow circles are for the taking lens:

The brass parts here are the focus screws, they can be seen with front plate removed. Lubricate them if the focus is sluggish. Please note that they can be turned easily, and if they're misaligned too much, you might need to do the focus calibration:

### Note for Assembly
There are small dots located on the screw hole of the front plate, this should fit together with the notch on the focus screw:

When installing the front plate, check the focus screw first before  先不要急著把螺絲鎖回去，先稍微轉動對焦旋鈕，然後透過螺絲孔觀察對焦螺絲是否有跟著旋轉，在正常狀況下對焦螺絲上的凹槽應該是要跟前面板上的凸點接合在一起，所以應該是不會旋轉的，如果有看到旋轉的狀況那表示角度可能跑掉了，調整一下再重新安裝一次吧。

### Focus Calibration
If the focus screws are misaligned and cannot be restored to the initial state, it's time for focus calibration. This will be a tidius job. In the worst case, the focus screw and the viewing lens are both in need of adjustment.

Turn the focus knob to infinity, put a grounded glass or a tracing paper in the film chamber:

And repeat the following steps: adjust the focus screws -> install the front plate -> check on a distant target (bright moon, landscape). It's done when the target is sharp and clear. You can further verify that with other distance mark like 2m, 1.8m on the focus knob, just remember it MUST be able to focus on infinity.

### Viewing Lens Calibration
When the target is sharp and clear from the film chamber, but not in focus from the view finder, you will need to adjust the viewing lens. The viewing lens is screwed to the front plate and fixed by a retainer plate with 2 screws. Remove those screws first (please refer to "Front Plate Removal" section, they're marked with yellow circles on the front plate), then loosen the retainer plate to free the lens. It's better to keep the retainer and the lens there for fine-tuning:

To calibrate it, first make the taking lens focused on a target and repeat: loosen the retainer a little bit -> adjust the viewing lens -> check the result from the view finder. Remember to put the screws back when you're done.

# Compur Disassembly
The low speed shutter on this camera is acting up, way slower than the indicated speed. Luckily, some grease oil can fix this problem.

### Tools
* Flat-blade screwdriver
* Grease oil

### Steps
After removing the [front plate](./front_plate.md) and the [rear lens](./lens_cleaning.md), we can remove the compur component now. First step is to remove the knob on the shutter lever. Use the screwdriver to hold against the groove on the nutï¼Œ and turn the knob in counter-clockwise direction:

Remove these four screws on this plate:

With the plate removed, you will see the shutter control lever. The metal ring in the picture below is the bearing between the lever and the compur component:

Remove the bearing to give some space to the shutter control lever. Then lift it up from the side next to the taking lens, and extract it from the front plate. After this is done, the compur component can be removed:

If you need to remove the middle lens, it can be easily removed now. The shutter control lever was not removed in the picture below. The thing in the blue circle is the shutter lever that will stick out of the front plate. The yellow circle shows how this lever couple with the compur component. When you cock the shutter lever, This little metal piece will be pushed to cock the shutter. And the screw hole here is for the cable release:

Do not forget to push the spring in this green circle back in when assembling it. Also, these five shutter blades could come off easily, any bents on them will cause shutter malfunctions, please be cautious.

Apply some grease oil to the gears here, and shutter works better:

Another side of the shutter component:

Different engraving for different shutter speed. The small dot on the inner ring shows which speed it is. The fastest shutter speed of this camera is 1/500 (not shown in the picture).

### Note for Assembly
While installing the compur component, the shutter and aperture lever should be coupled with the groove on the front plate:
